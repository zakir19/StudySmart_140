# **StudySmart** 📚📱

**StudySmart** is an Android application designed to help users manage their study sessions efficiently. Built using **Jetpack Compose**, **Room**, and **Android Services**, the app allows users to plan their study hours, create tasks, and track their progress. It also includes features to set reminders and cancel tasks after completion.

## Features ✨

- **Track Study Hours** ⏰: Set the number of hours you want to study for each subject.
- **Task Management** ✅: Add your own tasks, set deadlines, and mark them as complete once done.
- **Task Cancellation** ❌: Cancel ongoing tasks whenever you need to.
- **Timer Service** ⏳: Use the built-in timer to keep track of your study sessions using Android Services.
- **Persistent Storage** 💾: Study hours, tasks, and related data are stored locally using **Room** Database.
